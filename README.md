<b> 2. Abstract of the problem </b> <br>
   Mostly many documents are accepted as printed materials now. But still there is a need of handwritten documents at some points. In these cases differently abled people specially people who are visually impaired or who have issues with mobility will face difficulties in writing the documents.
   
   Currently Existing Solutions : 
         1. For the Visully impaired People : Braille Writing Equipment or An assistance of another people.
         2. For people have mobility issues : An assistance of another people.
   In Sri Lanka, Having a assistant people to perform the writing tasks is the most common solution such as in Genereal Certified Exams. 
   <br>
   <br>
<b> 3. Solution</b> <br>
   The solution is to replace the assistant person with an automated xy plotter which can recognizes the user's voice and write the words told by the user.
   This is basically to combine the existing speech to text converter and the xy plotter using a programmed microcontroller.
   <br>
   <br>
<b> 4. Basically How a XY plotter Works? </b> <br>
    Once you feed the sketch into the XY Plotter's software It will scan out the sketch and according to the X and Y coordinates it will draw the exact image on to a paper.

 <b> 6. Input Format </b><br>
   Input voice is set to be sent as the realtime voice as in Google Speech Recognizing System. 
   The sketches of the letters and numbers will be uploaded to the software.
